# Swift wrapper of JokeApi

A simple library to retrieve jokes from [Sv443's JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).

This project is still under construction and not yet ready for consumption until it is tagged with a v1.0.0 version.

## Source Stability

The versioning of this package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Source breaking changes to public API require a new major version.

We'd like this package to quickly embrace Swift language and toolchain improvements, and expect the latest Swift toolchains to be used (i.e. latest public Xcode version). So we will include updating the Swift version of the package as a new minor version bump.
